        h3 Floor decal
        p One of the greatest in-store graphics. Aside from straight-up buttkissing, prospects literally get to walk all over you, while already doing so anyway. Air is free, but looking at the floor of the store comes at a cost, bub.

        h3 Restaurant menu &amp; fries
        p The food is great, but the menu was made in dos on a dot matrix. Oh you can still read the actual printer ink if not for that spagetti blob. Don't fuck up dinner before you even cook it, make sure your restaurant menus water mouthes.
